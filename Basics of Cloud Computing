Histroy of Cloud Computing
->Earlier terms of Cloud 
Centralised Computing - A computing arch where all the processing is performed on a central server
Grid Computing - A group of compyters physica;;y connected to perform dedicated tasks or solve a complex program 
Distributed Computing - A model that allows resource sharing among multiple computers to improve efficiency and performance 
On- demand Computing - A model in which computing resources are made available on demand to the user as and when they are needed.
Hosting - A service through which storage and computing resources are provided to a individual or an organization to host data for services
Application service provider (ASP) - IA company that delivers application funcationality and associated services using a rental or usage based transcation pricing model 



1950 - 1960 - Mainframe Computing - central computing with dumb is introduced 
1960 - 1980 - Internet Advancements -> Arpanet TCP/ Ip & compuserve
1970 - First Virtual machine not in cloud is evloved 
1990 - Virtual privte networks ( Telecom offers VPN S )
1990 - The cloud -> Saw numeros cloud computing advances and the term cloud begins to be used 
1999 - Salesforce.com - > The first software as a service was introduced.
2006 - Amazon.com, Goodle Docs -> Amazon launched their EC2 internet as a service as beta. Goodgle Docs introduced 
2008 - MS Azure Azure internet as server was annonced.
Now - MS azure, Amazon, Google, IBm, Sales force 

Defination of CC - > On demend computing resources, Deliving over the internet 
And it is a computing service that is traditionally carried out locaaly on premises 
now performed remotely across the internet 

Defin 0> NIST or NIST -> A model that enables ubiquitous and convenient on-demand network access to a shared pool of configuravke computing resources (for eg, Networks, servers, Storage, Application, and services) 
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.


5 essensial characteristec -> 3 service model, 4 deployment model 

Charaterastics of CC:

Benefits of Cloud Computing : 
1. Coft - effective -> Pay-as-you-go-pricing, Pay only for the resources you use, Potential to lower the cost, No need of capital expenditure to get started 
2. Scalable -> Veritcal scallling ( adds a faster CPU , Adds memory ) , Horizontal Scalling ( Adding more servers) 
3. Elastic -> Add ( Addes resources when application is heavily used) or remove (Remove unnecessary resources when unnecessary) resources 
4. Business Continuity -> Buidling and deploying applications, It provides fast access to resources or applications you or your company need, Maintenance is done, No more software patching, hardware setup, upgrades,
and It management required.
5. Reliable - Data is save, Azure provides ( Data backups, Disaster recovery, Data replication). 
6. Secure -> Physical and digital security ( ensures both).
7. Metered -> pay only for what you use. (No need to IT experts to explains cost ) 


Risks of Cloud Computing:
1. Placing your trust in the cloud provider -> When you depend on a cloud service for a business critical task, U put the business in hand of the cloud vendor and quality of their work 
( Cloud service -> cirtical task -> Cloud vendor ) 
Eg -> Data -> Amazon or Azure ( storing all our data in service) -> NO service ( issue on service ) -> No access (Issue to fetch the data ) 
2. Service level Agreement -> Agreement between you and provider ( we hv to ensure if cloud provider is down, What they will provide you in return as it affect our busniess time )
3. Slow data acess -> ( U hv data in cloud and want to move it another data center or download locally, what if it is slow. So ensure that it fast as our internet speed t the cloud connection)
4. Legal or regulator complaints -> eg, financial or gvt entities cannot store data anywhere in the cloud. So they have to keep in mind to regulation and law associated with data should be considered.) 
eg -> (U hv company and hvaing health data, Employee data, Financial data, Credit card data regulated by government -> You will have to take into special consideration which cloud provider you use and wher they are storing our data.
5. Loss of potential or loss of customization or control - Eg, if you run your application locally, then you can customize it as you want. Assuming you have source code and the ability to perform the customization.
but when you deploy the same application in cloud, then the cloud provider is going to share access to that single application to everyone and you might not have as much control and potential to customize the application
as you would have on an on premise application.
6. Potential for unknown Costs- > Eg , One can know the cost of their own servers, storage, and software application if eveyrthing is run locally. What in cloud computing if you store and used more servers, storage and 
end up with more cost in bill. So Cost uptimation is something that you should keep in mind. 




Types of cloud computing -> 3 types
1. Public cloud,
2. Private Cloud,
3. Hybrid Cloud.

Public cloud - > Owned by cloud service provider, and also known as Hosting provider.
It provides Resources and services to multiple organization and users who connect to the cloud service via a secure network connection.
Typically over the internet.
Characteristics : 
Multiple end users -> Public cloud modes may make their resources available to multiple organization, 
Public access -> Public cloud provide access to the public.
Availbility -> Most common cloud type deployment model.
Connectivity -> Users and organizations are typically connected to the pubic cloud over the internet using a web browser.
Skills-> Public cloud do not required deep technical knwlege to set up and use.
Example: 
Businesses can use multiple public cloud service provider companies of varying scale.  Eg - MS Azure is public cloud provider.
